Forensicks, a cutting-edge digital investigation platform, revolutionizes the way investigation teams and individuals handle collected evidence. By enabling efficient parsing, searching, and visualization of evidence, Forensicks simplifies the investigation process, enhancing collaboration and providing advanced analytics capabilities. Unlike traditional tools, Forensicks addresses key challenges faced by digital analysts, including workflow speed, accuracy, and resource optimization.

Why Forensicks?

In the realm of digital investigation, existing tools, while effective, suffer from limitations. Forensicks was conceived to address these shortcomings:

    Streamlined Workflow: Forensicks accelerates the investigation process, ensuring tasks are completed swiftly and seamlessly.
    Enhanced Accuracy: By employing standardized and reliable parsers, Forensicks guarantees consistency and accuracy in results, a critical aspect of digital forensics.
    Resource Optimization: Forensicks' centralized server eliminates the need for high-powered individual machines, saving valuable hardware resources and reducing exhaustion for analysts.

How Forensicks Optimizes Investigations:

    Centralized Server: Forensicks operates on a centralized server, significantly reducing the hardware requirements for the analyst team. All evidence is stored and processed centrally, eliminating the need for multiple copies on various machines.

    Consistency: Utilizing trusted parsers ensures uniformity in results across different artifacts, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the investigation process.

    Predefined Rules: Forensicks allows the creation of predefined rules, saving time by triggering alerts for suspicious activities across past, present, and future cases. Analysts can create rules for specific patterns like encoded PowerShell commands or binary executions from temporary folders.

    Collaboration: Forensicks promotes collaboration by enabling team members to access parsed artifacts through a shared web interface. Features like tagging and timeline visualization facilitate efficient teamwork, replacing isolated individual efforts.

Use Cases:

    Case Creation: Investigators can create cases, each detailing a list of scoped machines for the investigation.

    Bulk Evidences Upload: Forensicks supports the simultaneous upload of multiple artifact files collected from scoped machines via various channels like Hoarder or KAPE.

    Evidence Processing: The platform processes these artifact files concurrently, ensuring timely analysis for selected machines or all machines within the case.

    Holistic View: Forensicks provides a comprehensive view of parsed artifacts, allowing users to browse and search across all machines involved in the case.

    Rules Creation: Investigators can save search queries as rules, enabling automatic alert triggers for similar patterns in future cases.

    Tagging and Timeline: Suspicious or malicious records can be tagged, and these tagged records are presented chronologically on a timeline. Additionally, information from external sources can be added to the timeline, enhancing context.

    Parsers Management: Forensicks empowers users to create custom parsers, ensuring that even files without predefined parsers can be processed effectively.

Forensicks stands as a beacon of innovation, transforming digital investigations by optimizing workflows, enhancing collaboration, and ensuring accuracy, ultimately revolutionizing the way digital analysts approach their work.
